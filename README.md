# LSTM-Based Model and Machine Learning Models in the Prediction of Stock Prices by Rahul Manda and Saketh Gudiseva

Here there are three copies of different notebook files regarding the project. Deep_Learning_Model.ipynb is the original parent paper file while Deep_Learning_Model(1).ipynb is the file that we made ith changes in the model structure. The Normalized_Data_Copy_of_Deep_Learning_Model.ipynb is our final file with changes to the data stock values for our study. The data stock values used in the project are in the seperate folder.
